# modulo_three

To avoid having to worry about whatever environment you're running it in, I provided a singlefile.js that can be copy-pasted straight into your browser developer console. I've broken up the files into separate files mostly to show that I know how to do it - it likely won't run as-is without creating a new Node.js project.

Ideally I'd use something like Jest to write proper unit tests, but again, to avoid forcing you to configure or install anything I just faked it using an "assert" function.
